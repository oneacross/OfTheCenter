    #GeneralProblem: How to set an initial value for a jquery ui slider?

        Use the jquery each function to iterate over!
        This will attach to the object!

        Found by googling "set initial value for jquery slider"
        http://forum.jquery.com/topic/dynamic-initial-value-of-a-slider

- add a vote button that updates the bias and slider

- add a picture for the article (like Facebook)

- add users

- a user can only have one vote per link

- a user can view all of their submitted links

- a user can see what their average vote is

- the slider should have a color gradient from blue (left) to red (right)

- the slider should have two sliders, one for the current bias and one for
  the user's vote.

- the algorithm for top links should be similar to hacker news or reddit

- the algorithm for bias should be simple at first (average)

- the algorithm for bias should be more complicated (earlier votes
  weighted more)
