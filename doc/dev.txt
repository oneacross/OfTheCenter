- set the default slider values to the link's bias

    #GeneralProblem: How to set an initial value for a jquery ui slider?

        Use the jquery each function to iterate over!
        This will attach to the object!

        Found by googling "set initial value for jquery slider"
        http://forum.jquery.com/topic/dynamic-initial-value-of-a-slider

- add a vote button that updates the bias and slider

    #TookLongerThanExpected

    Having trouble with rails forms and the update controller action.
    Solution was to use the HTML5 range input type.
    It is ugly, but it works. Can probably spruce up with CSS later.

- add a picture for the article (like Facebook)

    Search for the first link rel="image_src" element
    Default to the OfTheCenter logo

- links open up in a new tab by default

    Piece of cake with jQuery, add target="_blank" to all external links

- add users

- a user can only have one vote per link

- a user can view all of their submitted links

- a user can see what their average vote is

- the slider should have a color gradient from blue (left) to red (right)

- the slider should have two sliders, one for the current bias and one for
  the user's vote.

- the algorithm for top links should be similar to hacker news or reddit

- the algorithm for bias should be simple at first (average)

- the algorithm for bias should be more complicated (earlier votes
  weighted more)
