== OfTheCenter

The idea:

Submit links to political articles and rate how far left or right you think the
articles are.
The articles that are popular and most neutral will rise to the top.
It's like Reddit or Hacker News for politics.

Articles that are popular and left leaning will rise to the top on
left.ofthecenter.com.

Articles that are popular and right leaning will rise to the top on
right.ofthecenter.com.

People involved:
    Tristan came up with the idea at the San Jose Startup Weekend.
    Matt Mendell is the developer.
    Meg Tracz is the creative thinker.
